## TL;DR

You just want to say hello? Send us a [nice email](mailto:drip@mailbox.org?Subject=Nice%20incoming%20mail) :postbox:, ask to [join our Slack](mailto:drip@mailbox.org?Subject=Join%20Slack) or tweet :bird: at us [@dripberlin](https://twitter.com/dripberlin).

## What should I know before I get started?

We have prepared something for **you**: check out our [README](https://gitlab.com/bloodyhealth/drip/blob/master/README.md) for more information on how to set up and install everything you'll need.
[Ping us](mailto:drip@mailbox.org) if you could need some help :helmet\_with\_cross: !

Let us know if you want to suggest improvements for the README and open a merge request (which is just like Github's pull request)

## How can I condripute?

### Your First Code Condripution

We are fans of labels, at least for our issues. You can find a list of `newbie` issues [here](https://gitlab.com/bloodyhealth/drip/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Newbie).
If you decide to work on an issue, please click on `Create branch` based on that issue. You can find this as a dropdown option right under `Create merge request`.
This allows us to keep track of the issues that are related to an existing branch and tells everyone "somebody is working on it".

If you want to open a merge request, yeah :tada: exciting! We are using a template for merge requests to make sure we explain what we have done and why.
Keep in mind that people who will review your merge request are more motivated to do so when the merge request is well explained and ideally not too big.

### Reporting Bugs

You found a bug :bug:? Please feel free to investigate and save logs for more specific details.

Before creating a new issue, please review the [list of existing issues](https://gitlab.com/bloodyhealth/drip/issues) to make sure the bug is unknown. You are invited to describe the bug in all its details e.g. in what context/settings has it occurred?

To send us a new issue you can also use our [gitlab email](mailto:incoming+bloodyhealth/drip@incoming.gitlab.com). It will automagically add a new issue to the list with a description text taken from the body of your email.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Do you have suggestions for enhancing the app or for cleaning up some code? Fantastic!

Before creating a new issue, please review the [list of existing issues](https://gitlab.com/bloodyhealth/drip/issues) to make sure nobody else had the same idea before you! You are then invited to open a new issue with a somewhat extensive description, you can use emojis or GIFs if it helps :)!

To send us a new issue you can also use our [gitlab email](mailto:incoming+bloodyhealth/drip@incoming.gitlab.com). It will automagically add a new issue to the list with the title taken from the subject line and the description text for the issue taken from the body of your email.

### Thank you
