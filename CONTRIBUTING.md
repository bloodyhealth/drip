## TL;DR

You just want to say hello? Send us a [nice email](mailto:drip@mailbox.org?Subject=Nice%20incoming%20mail) :postbox:, toot :mammoth: [@dripapp@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@dripapp) or tweet :bird: at us [@dripberlin](https://twitter.com/dripberlin).

## What should I know before I get started?

We have prepared something for **you**: check out our [README](https://gitlab.com/bloodyhealth/drip/blob/main/README.md) for more information on how to set up and install everything you'll need.
[Ping us](mailto:drip@mailbox.org) if you could need some help :helmet_with_cross: !

Let us know if you want to suggest improvements for the README and open a merge request (which is just like Github's pull request)

## How can I condripute?

We are an open source project and we value contribution a lot but please keep some things in mind. :heart:

- the people maintaining the project are not many (atm 2) and have to do everything from answering press requests to fixing the bugs. Most of this work is done unpaid. (If you write a nice email your chances to get an answer are much higher than if you behave like a tech bro.)
- we have a plan in which direction drip should evolve. This means, even if it is not super transparent on gitlab all the time, we have a list which features to build and even more important which bugs need fixing and which dependencies need updates. Some of that will be already worked on, some things got stuck...
- drips core values are:
  ðŸ”® open source
  ðŸ©¸ feminist and gender inclusive
  ðŸ”’ secure: data entered stays with that person/on their device
  ðŸ”¬ science based: we implemented the symptothermal method
  This means we will never implement anything that opposes those core values. Some examples: we will never do a cloud integration, we will never do fertility prediction with simple day calculation...
- if you really want to contribute to the project in a sustainable manner, we are happy to join the game...

### Reporting Bugs or Making Suggestions

If you found a bug or have suggestions, please :one: first review the [list of existing issues](https://gitlab.com/bloodyhealth/drip/issues) to make sure the bug/suggestion is unknown; :two: after that, take time to investigate and write a detailed issue report. Best you use our [templates for bug /chore/ feature](https://gitlab.com/bloodyhealth/drip/-/tree/ca3cf16ff78dfcd32af7437abffe96e7c3213e93/.gitlab/issue_templates) (you can choose when creating a new issue) in gitlab or send us an email to our [gitlab email](mailto:incoming+bloodyhealth/drip@incoming.gitlab.com). It will automagically add a new issue to the list with a description text taken from the body of your email. Please attach screenshots or other helpful things.

### Your First Condripution

If you want to contribute to drips code or translation, please get in touch with us. We will be able to tell you if someone is already working on something similar, your idea does (not) comply with drips core values and many more things. Of course you can always build a drip version for your private use with everything you want, but please do not expect that we review and merge code that was not discussed before.

### Thank you
