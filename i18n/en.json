The values you enter for both feeling and texture of your cervical mucus are combined by drip into one of five values following the sympto-thermal method.\n\nFrom least to most fertile quality:\n· t = (dry feeling + no texture),\n· ∅ = (no feeling + no texture),\n· f = (wet feeling + no texture),\n· S = (no OR wet feeling + creamy texture),\n· S+ = (any feeling + egg white texture) OR (slippery feeling + any texture).\n\nOn the chart, cervical mucus is colored in blue: the darker the shade of blue the more fertile the quality of your cervical mucus.\n\nPlease note that drip does not yet support \"parenthesis values\": According to the sympto-thermal method, you can qualify a cervical mucus value by putting parentheses around it, to indicate that it doesn't fully meet the descriptors of one of the five categories, and instead is in between.
